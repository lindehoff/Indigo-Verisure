<!-- If your plugin defines device types, you can define them here.

	 Devices must specify their type (via the type attribute):

		relay (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		dimmer (ON/OFF/DIM/BRIGHTEN/SET BRIGHTNESS/STATUS)
		speedcontrol (ON/OFF/SET SPEED LEVEL/SET SPEED INDEX/INCREASE/DECREASE/STATUS)
		sensor (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		thermostat
		sprinkler
		custom

	 The first six inherit states, actions and events from Indigo. You can
	 also specify your own custom actions and additional states, if needed.
	 
	 All of the Device examples below specify the custom type and therefore
	 must define their own states and actions. See the other example device
	 plugins that illustrate overriding an existing native type (relay, dimmer,
	 thermostat, etc.).
	 
	 Devices must also specify a unique typeID - so, for instance, if you define
	 2 relay type devices then your plugin can distinguish between the two by
	 the typeID.

	<!-- This custom device illustrates how a plugin can update custom device
	states which can be used in Device State Changed triggers, conditionals,
	and inspected on Control Pages. The python runConcurrentThread() method
	will update the states every second.
